# MyreLisp Documentation

## Overview
MyreLisp is a domain-specific Lisp implementation designed to ease interaction 
with the SmartThings ecosystem.

Through provided utility functions, scripts written in MyreLisp can take full
advantage of all capabilities provided to native SmartApps, while providing
the same powerful metaprogramming features that you would expect from a lisp.

These pages serve as documentation of the language's syntax, execution model,
and standard library, while providing sample code to assist with development.
